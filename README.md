# Wirey UI

> Simple wireframe ui components built with react

## Philosophy

### Style agnostic

Most UI librarys come with pretty nice looking styles out of the box. While this is great for speedy development it has a tendency to inform design choices. This results in sites using these librarys looking eeriely similar and makes the web a less interesting place. 

Wirey UI strives to be style agnostic. Complonents come styled as simple wireframes out of the box . This forces developers to implement their own design choices and hopefully keeps things a little more interesting.

### Leverages custom properties

CSS custom properties have opened the doors to some exciting new styling possibilities. Any styles that are not essential to the function of a componet are styled using custom properties. These can be overidden with css or more excitingly they can easily be altered dynamically with JavaScript.
